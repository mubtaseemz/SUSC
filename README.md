# Science Unlimited Arduino Coding Resources

Hello, future scientists! This repository helps you to get started with Arduino. Arduino is an effective prototyping tool. When you will become a scientist, you will sometimes need to build your own tools. You can make them with Arduinos!

Past Project #1,#2,#3 here are selected projects from 2018. You can try them out on your own time. The folders starting with sensor contains sample code for the named sensors. You can find more about those sensors from the links provided inside each folders.

Did you know that your Arduino IDE is already installed with bunch of cool examples codes/sketches? Trying them out is a great way to get started. More on this: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/BuiltInExamples

int, #include, digitalRead()... want to know what the instructions you use or see mean? Click on the following link for description of different functions, variables and structures in Arduino: https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/

Check out what hackers around the world build with Arduinos. You can add your project from the design challenge here to share with your friends and the whole world. Visit this site: https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub
