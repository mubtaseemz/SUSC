#The AQT

Project Description: Our probe is designed to evaluate the air quality on Mars, judging it in criteria such as human breathability. Using values produced by our sensor, our program outputs the values in the form of lights from our LEDs. The values represent air quality in numerical form, which are then put through conditional statements to determine which LED(s) lights up. The various colours of the LEDs indicate the quality of the air, with BLUE being the best while RED is the worst.
